# React + Vite

This is a part of my portfolio for using React and Redux.

This application showcases a simple pizza ordering website using both React, Tailwind and Redux.
The project leverages the feature folder structure with a ui folder which contains components that are used across multiply features.
Navigation is handle by React router
The menu and order functions levages a hosted RESTful API and all order updates are done through the services/Action.js
