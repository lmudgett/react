Pizza Ordering Website

This project is part of my portfolio, showcasing my skills in React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS.
Overview

The application demonstrates a simple yet functional pizza ordering website. It incorporates modern web development practices, including:

    React Router for seamless navigation.
    Redux for state management.
    A feature folder structure for organized and maintainable code.
    A shared ui folder containing reusable components across multiple features.

Features

    Dynamic Menu and Ordering: The menu and order functionalities interact with a hosted RESTful API for real-time data.
    Order Management: All order updates are handled through services/Action.js, ensuring smooth integration with the API.
    Responsive Design: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive user interface.

Key Highlights

    Organized codebase using the feature folder structure for scalability and maintainability.
    Efficient state management with Redux, ensuring predictable and testable application behavior.
    Reusable components stored in the ui folder, promoting code reusability and consistency.
